# jooj
this is the bot that does general game things for the jojo zone discord, join now at https://discord.gg/edWTqDP


# how to run bot
this bot will take lots of edits to make work as it is not very portable atm, i will make it for portable sometime in the furute but not soon

# run on linux
run the following commands in the command line:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Starkid2u/jojo-bot/
$ cd jojo-bot
$ ./run.sh
```
if this is not the first time running the bot you can drop the git clone command

# run on windows
open a command line where you want the bot to go then run these commands
```
git clone https://github.com/Starkid2u/jojo-bot/
cd jojo-bot
run.bat
```
or just open the jojo-bot folder and double click the run.bat (you still need to do git clone though). i reccomend making a shortcut and putting it on your desktop if you run the bot a lot
